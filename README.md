### Hi there, I'm Anna! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing backend microservice modules for fintech company and here are some of my projects that I wrote at the beginning of my career as a java developer to get acquainted with technologies.

RESTful APIs: Java EE, Spring (Core, Boot, Data), PostgreSQL, Hibernate, JUnit, Mockito, Docker, Maven.

ðŸŒ± Using all these smart tools I am trying to write readable,
testable and well maintainable source code using best
patterns of software design.
